PROJECT 3

Our code design follows the instructions and directions he provides in the 
professor and TA videos.

The test files cp.c, is included, and have been 
added to the makefile in the test directory. They are ready to be compiled and run.

We created the classes for UserOpenFile and SysOpen file and started but not finished 
modifing PCB to contain an array of OpenUserFiles.

We added the Open(), Close(), Read() and Write() functons to exception.cc but we were not
able to finish the implementations.

The source code can compile and we are able to run the tests.

From the folder userprog, you can call 'make nachos' and 'nachos -x ../test/cp' to run
the test with the latest updates
